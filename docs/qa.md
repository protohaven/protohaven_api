`setup_discord_user` from `protohaven_api.automation.roles.roles`.

Go to https://protohaven.app.neoncrm.com/admin/accounts/1797 and remove association.

* [ ] When unregistered, `TEST_MEMBER_JOIN` directs to register with Neon

Override and register the user in Neon. Remove all roles from Discord user, and change its display name to something other than `Test Member`.

Add an extra role to the user via Discord.
