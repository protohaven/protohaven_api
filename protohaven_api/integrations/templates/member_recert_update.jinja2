<p>
Hi {{fname}},
</p><p>
You previously earned clearances for one or more tools that require periodic recertification.
</p><p>
Recertification ensures all members are prepared to use Protohaven equipment without harm to themselves, to the equipment, or to other members around them. We also use this process to spread changes to our policies and tools (such as when a tool is replaced by a different model).
</p>

{% if rm_clearance|length > 0 %}
<p>
<strong>Your clearance for the following tool(s) have been suspended</strong> until you complete the recertification process:
<ul>
{% for r in rm_clearance %}
<li>{{r.tool_name}}: {% if r.last_earned %}Last earned {{r.last_earned}}, {% endif %}due on {{r.due_date}}</li>
{% endfor %}
<ul>
</p>
{% endif %}

{% if new_pending|length > 0 %}
<p>
<strong>The following tools will soon be due for recertification:</strong>
<ul>
{% for r in new_pending %}
<li>{{r.tool_name}}: {% if r.last_earned %}Last earned {{r.last_earned}}, {% endif %}due on {{r.due_date}}</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
When the due date has passed, your clearance will be suspended for that tool until you've completed recertification.
</p>
{% endif %}

{% if rm_pending|length > 0 %}
<p>
<strong>We've recorded your recertification on the following tools, and restored any suspended clearances:</strong>
<ul>
{% for r in rm_pending %}
<p>{{r.tool_name}}: {% if r.last_earned %}earned on {{r.last_earned}}, {% endif %}next due {{r.next_deadline}}</p>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
</p>
{% endif %}

On behalf of all our members, thank you for helping us maintain a safe and useful shop!
