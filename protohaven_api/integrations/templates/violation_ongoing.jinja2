**At this time you have accrued ${{accrued}} in fees. The violation is ongoing and will accrue ${{fee}} per day until it is resolved.**
{% endif %}
For a full list of active violations, see https://protohaven.org/violations.

Please take immediate action to resolve the violation. {% if accrued > 0 %}To any accrued fees, please ask the shop tech on duty. {% endif %}We will send a confirmation the next business day to confirm the violation has been resolved.
