We're excited to have you join us at Protohaven, and we're sure you're excited to start making things - that's why we're giving you a coupon code for a free class!

<p>
<strong>{{coupon_code}}</strong>
</p>
<p>
The code above is good for one free class up to ${{coupon_amount}}; this covers all our basic classes. Just add that code when you go to sign up online at https://protohaven.org/classes.

{% if sample_classes %}

Here's a couple basic classes with open seats that you can register for today:

<ul>{% for l in sample_classes %}
  <li>{{l}}</li>{% endfor %}
</ul>

See you in the shop soon!
