Test Event: Please submit instructor log
Hi TestInstName,

This is a friendly reminder to submit your instructor log (if you haven't already) to receive payment for the class, and to grant clearances to students.

You can do this in under a minute by clicking "Submit Log" for a pre-filled form for the specific class at https://api.protohaven.org/instructor/class.

If you have any questions, please reach out to education@protohaven.org.

Thanks!
