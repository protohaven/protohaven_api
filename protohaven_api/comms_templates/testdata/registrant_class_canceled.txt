False
Your class 'Test Event' was canceled
Hi TestAttendeeName,

Unfortunately, we had to cancel your class Test Event (scheduled for January 1).

We can either refund the full amount of the class, or offer class credit if you'd like to enroll in a different class.

Please reach out to education@protohaven.org with your choice so we can start the process.

We're sorry for the change of plans - it would have been great to have you. If you're still interested in classes and tool instruction, please check our event schedule at https://www.protohaven.org/classes.

Hope to see you in the shop soon!
- Protohaven Staff
