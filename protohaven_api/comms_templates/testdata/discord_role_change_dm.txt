Your Discord Roles Are Changing
Based on your current membership state and your involvement in groups at Protohaven, we are taking the following actions to modify the roles assigned to your Discord account:

- Entry 1
- Entry 2

Roles affect your ability to see certain channels on Protohaven's discord server, and are determined by your account in Neon.

**To associate your Discord membership and retain your assigned Discord roles, go to https://api.protohaven.org/member?discord_id=testid, log in (if needed), then click "Save".**

If you think any of these actions are in error, please contact membership@protohaven.org ASAP. Otherwise, no action is needed.
