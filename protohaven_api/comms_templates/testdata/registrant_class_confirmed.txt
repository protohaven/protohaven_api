Your class 'Test Event' is on for January 1!
Hi ,

Get excited! Your class Test Event has 3 total students, and will be running on January 1

Please remember to wear appropriate clothing for the activity - this usually means close-toed shoes, with any long sleeves or hair pulled back.

If you have any questions, please reach out to education@protohaven.org.

Hope to see you in the shop soon!
